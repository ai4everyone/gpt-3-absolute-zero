Currently populated with the examples from the 'absolute-zero' branch of the following project :  https://github.com/ml4j/gpt-3-experiments

which was originally forked from https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-3-experiments and has been modified to only contain zero-temperature ( deterministic ) examples. Thanks to @minimaxir for his work and for making this repository open source.
