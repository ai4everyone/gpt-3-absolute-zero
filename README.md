# gpt-3-absolute-zero

A repo containing test prompts for [OpenAI](https://openai.com)'s [GPT-3](https://www.zdnet.com/article/openais-gigantic-gpt-3-hints-at-the-limits-of-language-models-for-ai/) [API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) and the resulting zero-temperature AI-generated texts, which both illustrate the model's robustness. All generated texts in this repo are _completely unedited and uncurated_ unless explicitly stated otherwise.

**Disclaimer: generated text content in this repository may be offensive. The READMEs of the corresponding examples will include an explicit content warning (CW) when this is the case.**

Currently populated with the examples from the 'absolute-zero' branch of the following project :  https://github.com/ml4j/gpt-3-experiments

which was originally forked from https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-3-experiments and has been modified to only contain zero-temperature ( deterministic ) examples. Thanks to @minimaxir for his work and for making this repository open source.
